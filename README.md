# SimpleDiceRoll
A simple and easy program for rolling dice with python1
This program is fairly easy to use. Make sure that you only answer questions with a "yes" or "no" or a number.
A common error is the program will not accept " yes" as input for yes or " no" as input for no. 
As a result, nake sure that you do not type a space in front of yes or no.
